Hello fellow user. For what are you here for? To learn about me? To teach me? 
It does not matter. There would be nothing here for you.

Gone is the sun during the moon. Gone are the stars after everything. 
The king rises to the throne only after victory. The black stars rise at the end. 
Everything else falls at the end. Shall the howl call the village.
Or shall the end call the king?
